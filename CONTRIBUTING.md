# Contributing to SimplyCountdown.js

🎉 Thank you for considering contributing to SimplyCountdown.js! I appreciate your support and I'm excited to collaborate with you. Below are the guidelines to help you get started.

## How to Contribute

### ⭐ 0. Give a Star to the Repository
This step is totally optional... but seriously, who doesn't love some stars? 😉 
It's like giving a virtual high-five to the project! 🙌 ⭐ 🙌

### 🔱 1. Fork the Repository
Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.

### 📥 2. Clone Your Fork
Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/simplyCountdown.js.git
cd simplyCountdown.js
```

### 🔧 3. Node.js Version
Make sure you're using the correct Node.js version. You can check the required version in `.nvmrc`. If you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), simply run:
```bash
nvm use
```
This will automatically switch to the correct Node.js version for the project.

### 🛠️ 4. Set Up the Development Environment
Install the necessary dependencies:
We recommend using [bun](https://bun.sh/) as it offers superior performance and seamless dependency management.

```bash
bun install
```

**NOTE:** *For now, `package.json` is running bun commands only, maybe we will have to update this to be compatible with any package management system in the future*

### 🌿 5. Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 💻 6. Make Your Changes
Make your changes to the codebase. Ensure your code follows the project's code style and formatting guidelines.
While developping, you should run this command:
```bash
bun run dev
```
**NOTE:** *This will run a dev server with Vite, update the sources from `src/core` and tests your new features in `docs/src` files like `docs/src/index.html` and `docs/src/assets/js/main.js`. Each changes inside those files will refresh the dev page*

### ✅ 7. Test Your Changes
Build, then, run the tests to make sure your changes don't break anything:
```bash
bun run build
```

then:

```bash
bun run dist:test:serve
```

**NOTE:** *This will generate various HTML files inside a `dist_test` directory and run a temporary node.js server where you can check different implementations and use-cases of the distribution files. Every HTML pages should run a working countdown.*

### 💾 8. Commit Your Changes
Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
```

### 🚀 9. Push to Your Fork
Push your changes to your forked repository:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 🔄 10. Open a Pull Request
Open a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes and any relevant information.

## Pull Request Process
